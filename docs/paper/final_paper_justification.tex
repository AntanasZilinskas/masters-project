\subsection{From \textit{SolarKnowledge} to \textsc{EVEREST}: Measured Performance Analysis}
\label{sec:sk2ev-measured}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct evaluation of the retrained \textit{SolarKnowledge} architecture on operational test data reveals fundamental performance limitations that necessitated the development of \textsc{EVEREST}. These results, obtained from actual model inference on the SHARP M5-72h test dataset (7,172 samples, 11 positive events), demonstrate measurable deficits in precision, calibration, and operational viability.

\textbf{Catastrophic precision failure.}
The retrained \textit{SolarKnowledge} v4.5 model, trained using the official training pipeline, exhibits complete precision failure on the M5-72h test dataset. Despite achieving 93.50\% nominal accuracy, the model produces \textbf{455 positive predictions with 100\% false alarm rate}, achieving \textbf{0\% precision and 0\% recall}. This catastrophic performance profile renders the baseline architecture operationally unusable, as every positive prediction triggers costly false alerts while missing all 11 actual solar flare events.

\textbf{Poor calibration performance.}
Calibration analysis reveals an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of \textbf{0.084} for the retrained \textit{SolarKnowledge} model, indicating substantial miscalibration between predicted confidence and actual accuracy. The model's probability outputs range from 0.000 to 0.998 with mean 0.085 and standard deviation 0.230, suggesting erratic confidence estimation unsuitable for operational decision-making.

\textbf{Architectural inefficiency.}
At 1,999,746 parameters, the \textit{SolarKnowledge} transformer requires substantial computational resources while delivering catastrophic operational performance. The standard transformer architecture fundamentally mismatches the extreme class imbalance (0.15\% positive rate) and precision requirements of solar flare prediction.

\paragraph{Precision-aware architectural innovations.}
\textsc{EVEREST} addresses these measured deficits through targeted architectural modifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Attention bottleneck:} Single-query temporal attention replaces global pooling, reducing spurious activations that contribute to false alarms.
\item \textbf{Evidential uncertainty:} Normal-Inverse-Gamma parameterization provides closed-form uncertainty quantification.
\item \textbf{Extreme value modeling:} GPD tail fitting explicitly models rare event statistics.
\item \textbf{Composite precision loss:} Multi-component objective directly optimizes precision-aware metrics.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Measured performance improvements.}
Direct comparison on identical test data demonstrates substantial \textsc{EVEREST} advantages:

\textbf{Calibration enhancement.}
\textsc{EVEREST} achieves an ECE of 0.036, representing a \textbf{56.7\% improvement} in calibration performance over the retrained baseline. This enhancement enables confidence-aware operational deployment, where prediction uncertainty guides decision-making protocols absent in the baseline architecture.

\textbf{Parameter efficiency through design.}
Despite adding uncertainty quantification, extreme value modeling, and precision-aware attention mechanisms, \textsc{EVEREST} achieves a \textbf{59.3\% parameter reduction} (1.999M â†’ 0.814M). This efficiency gain demonstrates that targeted architectural innovation, rather than model scale, drives performance improvements in rare event prediction.

\textbf{Operational viability transformation.}
The measured results demonstrate a fundamental transformation in operational viability. Where \textit{SolarKnowledge} exhibits catastrophic false alarm behavior that would overwhelm operational systems, \textsc{EVEREST} provides calibrated predictions suitable for real-world deployment. The elimination of 100\% false alarm rate, combined with uncertainty quantification, enables operational integration previously impossible with the baseline architecture.

\paragraph{Implications for space weather forecasting.}
These measured results establish that effective solar flare prediction requires architectures specifically designed for extreme class imbalance and operational precision requirements. Standard transformer approaches, despite high nominal accuracy, fail catastrophically on precision metrics critical for operational deployment. \textsc{EVEREST}'s targeted innovations---evidential uncertainty, extreme value modeling, and precision-aware attention---transform an operationally catastrophic baseline into a calibrated, uncertainty-aware forecasting system with measured performance suitable for space weather applications.

The 56.7\% calibration improvement, 59.3\% parameter reduction, and elimination of catastrophic false alarm behavior provide empirical justification for the architectural transition from \textit{SolarKnowledge} to \textsc{EVEREST}, supported by direct measurement on operational test data.
