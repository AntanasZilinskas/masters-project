# Case Study Comparison: July 2012 vs September 2017
## EVEREST Model Performance Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document compares two landmark solar flare events analyzed with the EVEREST model:
- **July 12, 2012 X1.4 flare** (moderate event, completed analysis)
- **September 6, 2017 X9.3 flare** (extreme event, planned analysis)

The September 2017 event represents the **largest flare of Solar Cycle 24** and provides an opportunity to demonstrate EVEREST's performance on a truly extreme space weather event.
