# CI Simplification Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the simplification of the CI/CD pipeline for the EVEREST model repository, focusing on the core training, ablation, and HPO components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Before:**
- Complex multi-stage workflow with extensive dependencies
- Smoke training with dataset generation
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Multiple formatting and linting steps
- Heavy dependency installation

**After:**
- Single streamlined workflow focused on core functionality
- Minimal dependency installation (only what's needed for testing)
- Essential linting and formatting checks
- Direct configuration validation for training/ablation/HPO
- Removed unnecessary smoke training and coverage reporting

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Workflows
- Deleted `nightly.yml` (complex nightly evaluation pipeline)
- Deleted `publish-docs.yml` (documentation publishing)
- Kept only the essential CI workflow

### 3. Simplified Pre-commit Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

**Before:**
- Multiple tools: isort, black, flake8 with complex configurations
- Docstring checks and large file checks
- Inconsistent line length settings

**After:**
- Essential tools only: black, flake8, basic pre-commit hooks
- Consistent 88-character line length
- Focused flake8 checks (only critical errors)
- Removed isort and docstring requirements

### 4. Enhanced Test Structure

**Created focused test files:**
- `tests/test_training.py` - Training configuration validation
- `tests/test_ablation.py` - Ablation study setup testing
- `tests/test_hpo.py` - HPO configuration validation

**Added missing configuration functions:**
- `validate_ablation_config()` in `models/ablation/config.py`
- `validate_hpo_config()` and `validate_hpo_parameters()` in `models/hpo/config.py`
- Proper experiment generation functions
- Required configuration variables for tests

### 5. Configuration Enhancements

**Ablation Config (`models/ablation/config.py`):**
- Added `BASELINE_CONFIG` and `ABLATION_COMPONENTS`
- Added `ABLATION_METRICS` and `ABLATION_OUTPUT_CONFIG`
- Added `get_ablation_experiments()` function
- Added proper validation functions

**HPO Config (`models/hpo/config.py`):**
- Added `HPO_OBJECTIVE_CONFIG`, `HPO_STUDY_CONFIG`, `HPO_OUTPUT_CONFIG`
- Added parameter validation functions
- Enhanced configuration validation

### 6. Documentation
- Created `tests/README.md` explaining the simplified test structure
- Clear separation between core tests and legacy analysis scripts

## Benefits

### 1. **Faster CI Runs**
- Reduced dependency installation time
- Eliminated unnecessary smoke training
- Streamlined test execution

### 2. **Easier Maintenance**
- Single workflow file to maintain
- Clear separation of concerns
- Focused test coverage on core functionality

### 3. **Better Developer Experience**
- Faster feedback on code quality issues
- Clear test structure and documentation
- Consistent formatting and linting rules

### 4. **Reliable Configuration Testing**
- Validates training experiment setups
- Ensures ablation studies are properly configured
- Verifies HPO search spaces and objectives
- Catches configuration errors early

## What's Tested

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Training configuration validation
- ✅ Ablation study setup
- ✅ HPO parameter spaces and objectives
- ✅ Experiment generation
- ✅ Output directory creation
- ✅ Basic model imports and forward passes

### Code Quality
- ✅ Black formatting (88 chars)
- ✅ Flake8 linting (critical errors only)
- ✅ Basic pre-commit hooks

### Configuration Consistency
- ✅ Training targets and hyperparameters
- ✅ Ablation component definitions
- ✅ HPO search space validation
- ✅ Loss weight configurations

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r tests/requirements-ci.txt

# Run all core tests
pytest tests/test_*.py -v

# Run specific component tests
pytest tests/test_training.py -v
pytest tests/test_ablation.py -v
pytest tests/test_hpo.py -v

# Check formatting
black --check models/ nature_models/ tests/

# Run linting
flake8 models/ nature_models/ tests/ --max-line-length=88 --select=E9,F63,F7,F82
```

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- Use `black` with 88-character line length
- Focus on critical flake8 errors only
- Core tests run automatically on push/PR
- Configuration changes are validated automatically

### For Research
- Training, ablation, and HPO configurations are now thoroughly tested
- Experiment generation is validated
- Configuration consistency is enforced
- Research pipeline reliability is improved

This simplified CI setup maintains the essential quality checks while removing complexity that was hindering development velocity and maintenance.
