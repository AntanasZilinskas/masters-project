This research aims to establish a standard for solar flare forecasting by introducing transformer-based \cite{RefWorks:RefID:3-vaswani2023provided,RefWorks:RefID:29-hoffmanntraining}, multimodal \cite{RefWorks:RefID:30-schmude2024prithvi}, and self-supervised learning strategies specifically tailored to complex solar data. By integrating diverse data types—spatial magnetograms, flux time series, and potentially additional solar observations—into a unified framework \cite{RefWorks:RefID:33-francisco2024multimodal,RefWorks:RefID:2-abduallah2023operational}, this project can yield richer, more accurate forecasts with longer lead times and enhanced interpretability \cite{RefWorks:RefID:35-licllmate:}.
