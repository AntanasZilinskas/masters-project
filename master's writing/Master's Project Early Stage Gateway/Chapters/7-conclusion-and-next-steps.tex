In conclusion, this project aligns latest transformer architectures with the pressing need for more accurate, interpretable solar flare forecasts. By systematically addressing the challenges of data complexity, rare events, and long-range temporal dependencies, it aims to push the boundaries of current methodologies and operational capabilities.

Moving forward, the immediate next steps involve finalizing the model design, initiating early experiments with multimodal transformers, and iteratively refining approaches based on preliminary results. Over subsequent terms, this iterative process will guide the transformation of theoretical concepts into a robust, high-impact predictive framework.
